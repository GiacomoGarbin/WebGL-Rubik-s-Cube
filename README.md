# WebGL-Rubik-s-Cube

This is my project for the Computational Geometry course at the University of Milan.
It took me about a month to complete the project and it was my absolute first experience with a graphic library.

The most relevant parts of the application are contained in the file: [rubik.js](https://github.com/GiacomoGarbin/WebGL-Rubik-s-Cube/blob/master/js/rubik.js)
